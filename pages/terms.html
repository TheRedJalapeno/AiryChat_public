						<h3>AiryChat Terms of Service</h3>
						<p><strong>Introduction and Acceptance of Terms</strong></p>
						<p>This document outlines the terms of service (the &#8220;Terms&#8221;) governing your use of
							AiryChat&#8217;s platform and services (collectively, the &#8220;Services&#8221;). By using
							our Services, you agree to these Terms and our Privacy Policy.</p>
						<p><strong>AI Tool Capabilities and Limitations</strong></p>
						<p>AiryChat provides access to state-of-the-art AI and LLM technologies, which are designed to
							assist users in generating content and performing a variety of tasks. However, it is crucial
							to understand the capabilities and limitations of these tools to ensure responsible usage.
						</p>
						<p>AI and LLMs do not possess personal experiences or opinions, nor do they have direct access
							to specific information such as laws, regulations, books, or any other material they were
							trained on. While they can generate content based on patterns and structures observed during
							their training, they cannot retrieve or verify factual information or the authenticity of
							sources.</p>
						<p>Even when AI tools have access to the internet, they do not inherently possess the ability to
							distinguish between valid and invalid information. Misinformation and disinformation can
							easily influence the content they generate, potentially leading to inaccurate or misleading
							results.</p>
						<p>Given these limitations, users must exercise human judgment when using AI and LLM tools.
							Users are responsible for validating the sources, citations, facts, and legal matters
							related to the content generated by these tools. Users should not rely solely on
							AI-generated content for decision-making, especially in contexts that require accurate
							factual information, professional advice, or legal guidance.</p>
						<p>By using our services, you acknowledge the limitations of AI tools and agree to use them
							responsibly.</p>
						<p><strong>Eligibility</strong></p>
						<p>To be eligible to use AiryChat Services, you must agree to abide by these Terms of Service,
							our Privacy Policy, and any other policies we post on the AiryChat platform. You are
							expected to use our services responsibly and for lawful purposes only. Your access and use
							of the services must be within a country or region where our services are legally available.
							Any necessary account registration should be completed with accurate and current
							information. As a user, you must understand and acknowledge the limitations of AI and LLM
							technologies as described in our Terms of Service. While there isn&#8217;t a specific age
							requirement for using our services, if you&#8217;re under the age of majority in your
							jurisdiction, you should review these terms with a parent or guardian to ensure
							understanding and agreement. By using our Services, you confirm that you meet all of these
							eligibility requirements. If you do not meet these requirements, you must not access or use
							our services.</p>
						<p><strong>Account Security</strong></p>
						<p>You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and password and for
							all activities that occur under your account. You agree to immediately notify us of any
							unauthorized use of your account.</p>
						<p><strong>Intellectual Property Rights</strong></p>
						<p>All intellectual property rights in the Services are owned by AiryChat and its licensors. You
							have no right to copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of our Services, nor may
							you reverse engineer or attempt to extract the source code of our software.</p>
						<p><strong>User Content</strong></p>
						<p>As a user of AiryChat, you retain all rights to your questions, answers, and any files you
							upload (&#8220;User Content&#8221;). You must ensure that all User Content uploaded to
							AiryChat is your own intellectual property and is not legally prohibited in either your
							country of residence or the United States.</p>
						<p>In providing our services, AiryChat works in partnership with third-party service providers,
							including OpenAI and Google. By using our Services, you acknowledge and agree that your User
							Content may be transmitted to these partners. While AiryChat does not claim any ownership
							rights over User Content, we cannot control how our partners use the data once it is
							transmitted to them. We highly recommend reviewing our partners&#8217; respective terms of
							service and privacy policies to better understand their data usage practices.</p>
						<p>AiryChat commits not to use any customer data without explicit consent from the user, beyond
							anonymized data usage for analytics and service optimization purposes. Your trust is
							important to us, and we strive to uphold the highest standards of data privacy and security.
						</p>
						<p><strong>Subscription Plans and Payment</strong></p>
						<p>We offer various subscription plans for our Services. You agree to pay all applicable fees
							related to your use of our Services. We may change our pricing, but we will notify you in
							advance of any increases.</p>
						<p><strong>Termination</strong></p>
						<p>AiryChat reserves the right to terminate user accounts for violation of these terms or for
							apparent violations of laws applicable to AiryChat LLC or the user. Termination is immediate
							upon detection of a terms violation, and no prior notice will be given.</p>
						<p>Upon termination, users will no longer have access to their account. The account will be
							locked, but not deleted. Appeals against termination decisions can be requested by emailing
							support@airychat.com.</p>
						<p><strong>Disclaimer of Warranties</strong></p>
						<p>Your use of our Services is at your sole risk. Our Services are provided on an &#8220;as
							is&#8221; and &#8220;as available&#8221; basis without warranties of any kind, either
							express or implied, including, but not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability,
							fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. We do not warrant that the services
							will be accurate, reliable, secure, available, or error-free, that defects will be
							corrected, or that the Services or the servers that make it available are free of viruses or
							other harmful elements.</p>
						<p><strong>Limitation of Liability</strong></p>
						<p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, in no event will AiryChat, its officers, directors,
							employees, partners, or agents be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special,
							consequential, or punitive damages, including, but not limited to, loss of profits, data,
							use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from your access to or use of or
							inability to access or use the Services and any unauthorized access, use, or alteration of
							your transmissions or content, whether based on warranty, contract, tort (including
							negligence), or any other legal theory, whether or not we&#8217;ve been informed of the
							possibility of such damage.</p>
						<p><strong>User Responsibilities</strong></p>
						<p>Users are responsible for their own activities and any consequences thereof while using our
							Services. Users must comply with our policies and terms and respect the rights and dignity
							of others. In the event a user fails to comply with these conditions, AiryChat reserves the
							right to terminate the user&#8217;s access to the Services.</p>
						<p>It&#8217;s important for users to understand that AiryChat is a tool and should not be used
							irresponsibly. It can facilitate tasks and offer AI-powered insights, but it does not
							replace human judgment and should not be solely relied upon for decision-making.</p>
						<p><strong>Email Communications</strong></p>
						<p>By using AiryChat, you agree to receive certain communications in connection with the
							platform. For example, you might receive updates about new features, promotional
							communications for new products or features, and important news or announcements. You can
							opt-out of non-essential communications at any time by clicking the
							&#8216;unsubscribe&#8217; link at the bottom of the associated email.</p>
						<p><strong>Changes to These Terms</strong></p>
						<p>We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. If we make changes, we will notify
							you. Your continued use of our Services after we post the changes will indicate your
							acceptance of the updated Terms.</p>
						<p><strong>Contact Information</strong></p>
						<p>If you have any questions about these Terms, please contact us at support@airychat.com.</p>
